    "## **Prompt Engineering Quiz 💡**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "**What is prompting?**  \n",
    "Answer: Prompting is the way we give instructions or questions to an AI so it will give us what we want. It’s like telling the AI what task to do and Ai will tell us how to do it or it will generate text/ step how we can do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "**In the following prompt, which part describes the primary task?**  \n",
    "Prompt: *“Explain how car batteries work using non-technical language that someone without any mechanical knowledge could understand and interpret.”*  \n",
    "Answer: The primary task is “Explain how car batteries work.” The rest gives extra details on how to explain to the non-technical person so that he will understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "**When you are using a gen AI tool to create a healthy three-course menu that requires a certain number of calories, which prompting element will ensure the menu is more practical?**  \n",
    "Answer: Adding constraints like calorie count makes the menu practical because it matches health needs. plus adding the age of the person so that it will not burdenize. or adding any kind of allergic(if have) so it will not add that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "**Prompting with audio to receive a visual representation is called what?**  \n",
    "Answer: ***multimodal prompting***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "**What does a human-in-the-loop approach to prompting emphasize?**  \n",
    "Answer: It emphasize that human should keeps checking, guiding, and improving the AI response instead of leaving everything to AI alone. in simple word human should do proof reading so thier is less mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6\n",
    "**When the initial prompt \"Create a dataset\" is too broad, what should you do to refine it?**  \n",
    "Answer: We should add details like what kind of dataset, how many entries, and for what purpose, so the AI gives a clear and useful result no the garbage.\n"

    "### ✅ Reflection Question\n",
    "\n",
    "How could you use AI to **organize recurring tasks** (like meetings, deadlines, or resources) at your workplace?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Smart Scheduling Assistants\n",
    "\n",
    "AI tools like Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, or specialized scheduling apps (e.g., x.ai, Clara) can automatically schedule recurring meetings by analyzing participants’ calendars, suggesting optimal times, and even sending invites without manual input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automated Reminders & Follow-ups\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can automatically generate reminders for upcoming deadlines or meetings, tailored to your preferences (email, chat, push notifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also send follow-up emails or messages after meetings to ensure action items are tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Task Prioritization & Deadline Management\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-powered task management tools (like Asana with AI features, Monday.com, or Todoist) can prioritize recurring tasks based on urgency, workload, and historical completion times.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can adjust deadlines dynamically if previous tasks were delayed, keeping the schedule realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resource Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can analyze project data and recurring task requirements to allocate resources (people, tools, budget) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could suggest who should lead a recurring meeting based on workload or past participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Knowledge & Resource Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-driven knowledge bases or chatbots can organize and surface relevant resources (documents, guidelines, contact info) related to recurring tasks or meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it easier for everyone to access what they need without digging through emails or drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Integration Across Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can sync tasks and reminders across calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook), project management tools, and communication platforms (Slack, Teams) so nothing falls through the cracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Pattern Recognition & Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, AI can identify patterns in how recurring tasks are handled — like meetings running over time or deadlines frequently missed — and suggest optimizations (shorter meetings, earlier deadlines)."
